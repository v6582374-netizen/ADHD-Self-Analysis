<h2 id="cXbln">Preface</h2>
I was successfully diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine (Zhejiang First Hospital). The specific medical process is not the focus of this article, as there are already many such articles available.

However, there is one point I need to clarify. I actually sought diagnosis twice. The first time, I went to Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital because I read an article on _Qingshan_ suggesting it was easier to get diagnosed there. The result? I went in unaware that Shaw Hospital requires communication with parents. My relationship with my parents is poor, and they simply do not understand me.

I explained the situation to Dr. Jia, hoping she would at least listen to my personal statement or glance at the developmental history I had painstakingly written. She just kept saying, "This is how we do things here. If you think you can't be seen here, go somewhere else, like Dr. Lu at Zhejiang First Hospital or Dr. Liu Fei in Shanghai."

In other words, I waited for half a day, spent the money, and barely communicated anything before being shown the door... Because I couldn't pass the "parental barrier," none of the subsequent procedures could proceed.

I understand clearly that for manifestations prior to age 12, parental testimony is a crucial reference. There is no problem with this logic per se, but it fails to account for many people's issues with their **families of origin** (in fact, children from dysfunctional families are more likely to have ADHD). Thus, this practice is simultaneously correct and contradictory.

So, I can only say: choose your hospital based on your own situation. If, like me, you communicate poorly with your parents, or your parents don't understand you at all, or they lack the ability to express themselves correctly, do not go to hospitals that mandate parental involvement. In the end, it will only deepen your emotional distress.

<h2 id="ItKC7">Problems with Existing Articles</h2>
Many authors who submit to _Qingshan_ are indeed ADHD or ASD (though the possibility of misdiagnosis is high, and they may not know it themselves), but not everyone has strong self-analytical skills. I see many people failing to grasp the key points, writing about trivialities that cannot be linked to actual pathology, which can easily mislead those who are uninformed.

Some articles are too brief, describing only isolated examples or very insignificant instances. Then, you find a bunch of people in the comments feeling like "this is exactly me," starting to suspect they have ADHD too...

Other articles are genuinely exhausting to read. Honestly, I don't have the patience for most of them. Some write prose, some write fiction, others write poetry—describing the weather, what they ate, what homework they did—it feels like reading a WeChat Moment (social media feed). I'm not saying these articles are bad; everyone has the freedom to submit, and many people do enjoy such content. However, when I started following _Qingshan_, I wanted to understand ADHD systematically and find more **substantive content** (_dry goods_), so these articles didn't suit my taste.

Furthermore, if the hierarchy of an article is complex, WeChat Public Account articles become difficult to read. You scroll for ages and still can't make sense of the subheadings; it’s messy. I am not sure if people will have the patience to read my 10,000+ word article on that platform.

<h2 id="FevJn">Just a few stories</h2>
First, please forgive me for not revealing my entire story, as releasing certain private details would have a significant impact on me personally.

Originally, I wrote my developmental history chronologically, but that was rigid and unreadable. So, in this article, I have switched to a modular explanation based on symptoms. I will deliberately delete some valueless language; I want this article to be entirely altruistic.

_Note: The seven stories I relate below describe continuous and frequent phenomena._

<h3 id="wGV8B">The Situation Deteriorates</h3>
Actually, I planned to look into this issue a long time ago, but I kept procrastinating until recently, when the feeling of being torn apart and helpless became increasingly severe. There were days when I felt depressed, accompanied by severe anxiety, staying awake all night. The next day, while other classmates went to class, I would sleep in the dorm. Clearly, I no longer had a normal life, so I couldn't delay any longer.

I am a university student who transferred from a junior college (_Zhuan Sheng Ben_). I have currently just started my undergraduate studies. I haven't attended class for a continuous month. Almost all my course teachers have sent me warnings about being disqualified from exams; failing my courses is essentially set in stone.

Despite reaching this point, I still couldn't control myself enough to go to class. Even if I forced myself into the classroom, I couldn't sit still. I would often sneak out to smoke or simply skip out halfway through.

<h3 id="IvMDM">My Hands: The "Perpetual Motion Machines"</h3>
I am not the type with large-scale hyperactivity—the kind who flails around and looks obviously abnormal. I am not like that. I belong to the category of constant micro-movements, but not the nervous nail-biting of a neurotypical person. I feel like I haven't stopped for a single second.

If I remember correctly, my involuntary, purposeless, rapid, and repetitive muscle movements began in junior high school.

The most prominent symptom at the time was "picking and gnawing at my fingers." This issue brought immense harm to my life; arguably, without this problem, my childhood would have been 50% happier.

At the time, my family didn't know why I had these movements; they simply regarded it as a "bad habit." I received a lot of scolding and criticism for it. I didn't know why either—I really didn't! I just couldn't control it; it was completely unconscious. Precisely because it was unconscious, no matter how much I was criticized, I couldn't change the habit.

To cover up this "bad habit," I found an excuse. I told my parents I bit my hands because I was nervous. Of course, only now do I realize that I was lying to myself back then too.

How severe was it? At its worst, I would act like a **rabid badger**, gnawing at the knuckles of my thumbs until the calluses were gone and the red raw flesh was exposed. Only then would I stop. But I stopped not because the hyperactivity ceased, but because the pain of destroying my flesh any further was unbearable for my young self. As a result, my thumbs still have scars that won't fade; they are very unsightly.

After entering high school and even university, the "hand biting" situation alleviated, but it transformed into other forms of hyperactivity.

+ In high school, I would constantly squeeze my pen or spin it with force. Since the pen was what I touched for the longest time, as long as it was in my hand, it could never be in a static state.
+ University was even more bizarre (_abstract_).
+ For example, when reading, I would constantly "rub" the paper. I put "rub" in quotation marks because it was actually a repetitive process, cycling endlessly until I closed the book.
+ When my hands were empty, I would often interlock my fingers and squeeze them together forcefully.
+ I would constantly use the right side of my middle finger to press against my nose—a very strange behavior.
+ I would constantly press and rub the fingernail of my middle finger, to the point that the nail color turned dark and looked terrible.
+ My fingernails could never exceed half a millimeter in length because as soon as a bit of white nail showed, I would bite it off.

There are probably many other unconscious, rhythmic movements, but it's hard to recall or describe them all.

<h3 id="UvS4r">Unsolvable Carelessness</h3>
"Being careful" is a pseudo-proposition for me. For me, the jumps in thinking and the shifting of vision are impossible to control, so subjectively telling myself to "be careful" is just empty talk.

I tried creating an environment free of distractions, strictly regulating my problem-solving process, checking multiple times, etc., but it was all in vain. In the end, errors would still appear in inexplicable places. It was truly magical, like being cursed. When I introspected on my neural activity at those moments, I felt that my thinking "skipped" at the point of the error—either collided with other thoughts in my brain or pulled away by external distractions. In short, it derailed, causing the carelessness.

<h3 id="b6GJ3">The "Armchair Strategist" (Paper Tiger)</h3>
To put it bluntly, I feel I am very smart, but many things cannot be implemented.

For example, I remember one incident vividly. I was in a cram school, facing a difficult problem. The teacher asked what method should be used. I don't know where the idea in my brain came from—it was just intuition—so I whispered, "Four points concyclic." I was right; I was the only one who thought of it.

But only I knew that I could only stay at the "idea" stage. If asked to actually solve the problem and perform the calculations subsequently, I might have done the worst job of all.

I had countless methodologies, so much so that in the last month before the Gaokao (College Entrance Exam), I still believed I had hope to turn the tide and get into Zhejiang University. That was until the final score gave me a huge slap in the face, knocking my head clean off.

There were many such incidents, so countless times I heard the word "ambitious but incompetent" (_Hao Gao Wu Yuan_) from teachers and parents. I can't blame them. After all, a person who genuinely believes they can get into Zhejiang University but ends up in a vocational college—isn't that a delusional person?  
It is only now that everything makes sense.

<h3 id="qs8XU">Being a Pirate, Not the Navy</h3>
**"It's better to be a pirate than to join the navy."** Steve Jobs said this 30 years ago. Here, "pirate" symbolizes freedom, ungovernability, challenging rules anytime and anywhere, breaking rules, and refusing to stick to convention. The "navy" is the opposite.

I certainly don't want to be in the navy. It's like asking me to take the civil service exam and join the system—I'd rather you just kill me.

Many people have said my personality is extreme and paranoid. For instance, I clashed with most teachers, especially those rigid old fossils. I didn't want to complete any tasks they assigned, nor did I want to agree with any of their statements. From childhood to adulthood, I was the most unorganized person. In class, I never cared about the teacher's thoughts; during activities, I acted like I was in my own living room.

I have always prioritized my own ideas, always walking a solitary path. I even felt that those "disciplined" kids were useless.

Honestly, I'm a bit of a dualist. In my eyes, people are either geniuses or idiots, because the mediocre people in the middle get categorized as the latter.

Of course, this isn't to flaunt how smart I am; there are plenty of people in group chats wiser than me. I'm just honestly expressing this mindset, so don't flame me—I really do have a disorder.

<h3 id="uOnjI">Am I the Only One Who Hears That Sound?</h3>
Often, I need absolute silence. For example, in the library, even though it is already very quiet, it's not enough for me. The slightest sound makes me furious—the turning of pages, the typing on keyboards, whispering. These are actually reasonable sounds, not noise, and neurotypical people wouldn't be affected at all.

But for me, it is completely unbearable, to the point where I have had conflicts with classmates countless times.

<h3 id="wN2oo">Impulse is the Devil</h3>
The consequences of my impulsivity make me loathe myself.  
Actually, this part should theoretically be the longest, but basically, I can't show any of it. They are mostly major events that shifted the gears of my destiny, and the nature of them is quite severe.

I think if I hadn't learned about ADHD and actively sought treatment, I would likely fall into an abyss in the future and commit crimes.

Oh, there seems to be a small anecdote I can tell. Once, my high-power electric cooking pot was confiscated. Other classmates whose pots were confiscated just accepted their bad luck. Only I angrily went to argue with the dorm matron. The argument failed, so I snatched it. The matron couldn't overpower me, so she called the campus police. Despite this, I still took my pot back.

<h3 id="BRUdD">Some Unexpected yet Logical Phenomena</h3>
**Have you ever eaten earthworms?**  
In junior high, I loved _Man vs. Wild_. In fact, I particularly liked that kind of wilderness survival environment. That complex environment filled with a sense of danger made me feel comfortable; nature provided me with a naturally distracting environment.  
It might sound strange, but I would imitate Bear Grylls and look for earthworms to eat in the park because I found it stimulating. I mean, many people like wilderness survival, but what normal person goes digging for worms to eat in a park?

**I love driving very much**  
If economic conditions allowed, I believe I would be an excellent racing driver. I especially like driving manual transmission cars (automatic transmission requires no operation, which bores me to death). This is a naturally multitasking activity: I need to simultaneously pay attention to the road ahead, the coordination of clutch and gas, gear changes, and passenger conversation. This makes me feel very comfortable.

**I don't know the date of the Spring Festival**  
My understanding of time seems to be different from others. Look at the questions below and you'll understand.

+ _When is the Spring Festival?_ I don't know, and I can't be bothered to check. I guess when firecrackers go off, it's Spring Festival.
+ _When are the finals?_ I don't know. I'll know the day before the exam anyway, so I'll prepare then.
+ _When does school start?_ I don't know, probably in a few months. I'll deal with homework then.
+ _When is the holiday?_ I don't know. When my roommates start packing, it must be the holiday.
+ _What day is it today?_ I don't know. Is this important? Is there any difference between Monday and Sunday?
+ _What month is it now?_ I don't know, but it seems cold, so probably a month between December and February.
+ _When is the homework deadline?_ I don't know. The system will warn me when it's close to the deadline anyway; it won't be too late to do it then.

**Why hasn't the apocalypse arrived yet?**  
When I was a child, I often had this expectation. Just imagining the scene of "black clouds crushing the city" made me feel comfortable because ordinary days were too bland and lacked stimulation.  
Or when I'm on a plane, it would be best if some accident suddenly happened and threw me onto a desert island—that would be much more interesting than simply flying.  
Or, I would stare out the window in class, wishing an alien would suddenly descend from the sky. I would be the first to discover him, and perhaps I would become a hero.

<h2 id="wcIJC">Brain Map Analysis (AI)</h2>
![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2025/png/52258267/1764222547720-5a679bfb-48e0-4f86-9739-1d5ea1ef4db7.png)

Regarding this infrared brain map (fNIRS), I know the reference value might not be huge. However, after looking around _Xiaohongshu_ (Little Red Book), I found my data is a bit outrageous. The values differ significantly from the normal standards (control group), so I'll do some analysis.

Here are a few main anomalies:

**A. Waveform Trend: Reversed**  
_Meaning:_ This means that when I perform thinking tasks, the oxygenated hemoglobin in the detection area does not rise as expected but instead shows a downward or flat trend. This appears in the chart as no obvious peak in the gray shaded area (task period), but rather a downward slope.

**B. Integral Value and Slope: Negative**  
This seems to be the most outrageous part. My S-Integral (total intensity of activation) is entirely negative (the prefrontal lobe even hit -509); the K-Activation (slope) is also entirely negative.  
_Meaning:_ Negative integrals and negative slopes once again quantify and confirm that brain activity during the task was below baseline, or "negative activation" occurred. This usually indicates insufficient mobilization of that brain area or an inverted response pattern.

**C. Initial Activation: None**  
_Meaning:_ At the beginning of a task, the brain usually has a rapid response. My report shows this response is missing.

**D. Lateralization: None**  
_Meaning:_ Normally, when performing language tasks, most people's left brain (left temporal lobe) is more active than the right; this is called "left-side dominance." Your report shows no obvious dominance on either the left or right, appearing relatively symmetrical and flat/low.

**AI's Detailed Analysis:**  
It must be noted that this report certainly cannot "qualify" any behavior directly, as I cannot be sure if there was emotional influence at the time (I feel there wasn't). But it at least reveals an underlying mechanism of my brain's operation:

My brain's "arousal threshold" is extremely high. I am very self-aware of this. For matters of general intensity, my prefrontal cortex simply "can't be bothered," and may even enter a state of inhibition or dormancy. The VFT (Verbal Fluency Test) is usually boring—just saying words, or even counting from 1 to 30. Actually, when I counted halfway, I got curious about when it would end and felt annoyed.

When facing boring (low dopamine) things, people with strong prefrontal cortices can force themselves to suffer through it, but I cannot. No matter how severe the consequences of skipping class, I uncontrollably run out.

<h2 id="TD0xz">How to View the Proliferation of "Cyber ADHD"</h2>
Nowadays, many people believe they have ADHD just based on some one-sided internet clips. This phenomenon is indeed headache-inducing. It not only exacerbates the scarcity of medical resources but also prevents those who are truly troubled from getting appointments.

Before I planned to get diagnosed, I browsed a lot of Chinese and English books, videos, and frontier papers. I basically read everything I could find. Then I seriously recalled my past, to the extent that I unknowingly wrote nearly 100,000 words of developmental history to compare my situation with clinical symptom descriptions (of course, I deleted the fluff and was left with 10,000 words). Actually, there was no need to write so much; I could have just verbally recounted it to the doctor.

Secondly, resemblance does not mean having the disease. It requires the symptoms to be **long-term**, consist of **multiple items**, and be **more intense** than in peers.

Note the three keywords: "Long-term," "Multiple," and "More Intense." So, many comrades see keywords like "lack of concentration" or "procrastination" and start to pigeonhole themselves. This behavior is very foolish because Einstein said, "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."

Think about it:

+ Many people bite their hands, but how many bite them for ten years and gnaw them into deformity?
+ Many people hate school, but how many push themselves to the brink of expulsion?
+ Many people get distracted, but how many are distracted every single moment, to the point of falling into depression?
+ Many people are impulsive, but come on, giving up lemonade to buy mango sago is not impulsivity.

I'm not saying you have to be at my level to seek diagnosis, but adults have their own judgment. Just understand my point.

If you have indeed been responsible to yourself as described above, but for various reasons did not get the expected diagnosis, the following incomplete suggestions can be considered:

1. Reflect on your psychology: have you brainwashed yourself due to a consistency bias, to the point of detaching from facts?
2. Considering the complexity of psychiatry, the risk of misdiagnosis certainly exists, especially for those with less typical symptoms or who are below the diagnostic threshold. If this matter is truly that important to you, you can choose more qualified doctors in Shanghai or Beijing. If conditions permit, diagnosis overseas is also an option, until you are confirmed or you give up.
3. However, since the symptoms haven't reached the level of diagnosis, could you consider meditation, exercise, and diet for improvement?
4. Or, if the doctor agrees, you can take some second-line ADHD medications to alleviate symptoms.

<h2 id="wzm1v">The Fundamental Contradiction of ADHD Diagnosis</h2>
First, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder itself is extremely complex. Oversimplifying this issue is a very foolish act. To minimize the probability of misdiagnosis, detailed and in-depth inquiry is necessary. This means the consultation time must be long. But in China, this is indeed hard to achieve. This is the fundamental contradiction.  
The less time spent on inquiry, the fewer details are understood, and the greater the probability of misdiagnosis.

<h3 id="itGcB">Psychological Analysis of Diagnostic Problems</h3>
Charlie Munger emphasized the "Man with a Hammer Syndrome" countless times, meaning: to a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail. This phenomenon also exists in medicine.

There are many types of mental illnesses, but many pathologies share some degree of intersection. A doctor specializing in diagnosing Disease X will be more inclined to judge the patient as having Disease X, even if the patient may have more than one issue, or not that issue at all.

Take myself as an example. I initially went to the school doctor and explained my recent state. He said, "Your situation isn't ADHD; it's pure anxiety." He claimed that since I could sit there quietly and chat with him, I didn't have ADHD. At that moment, I knew he didn't understand ADHD at all.  
Then he asked me to register with him at a hospital in Hangzhou later. I only then learned he was an external expert hired by the school, and guess what? Coincidentally, he specializes in anxiety disorders.

Afterward, he prescribed medication for anxiety and depression. I took it for a week, and my state basically didn't change. Because my anxiety is (most likely) a comorbidity of ADHD. You know, if true ADHD is undiagnosed in childhood and one experiences long-term misunderstanding and self-doubt, anxiety and depression are very likely to appear in adulthood.  
So, just giving me mood medication didn't solve the problem at its root because ADHD is my "primary disease." If my distraction and impulsivity don't get better, I will naturally continue to be anxious.

I am not saying this doctor was wrong. In fact, he was very good, and most doctors can be objective. But this limitation inevitably exists, and people should at least be aware of it.

Similarly, for doctors treating ADHD, with every patient who visits, there is a subconscious question in their mind—is he, or is he not, ADHD?  
This already presents a problem. Many mental illnesses with a "D" cause symptoms similar to ADHD—ASD, RSD, PTSD, etc.  
When this ambiguity exists, and the doctor lacks the ability or authority to diagnose the patient with other diseases, errors can occur.

There is another psychological phenomenon—people subconsciously tend to avoid inconsistency. For example, if a person "cyber-diagnoses" themselves with ADHD and even tells those around them (regardless of whether others believe it), then afterwards, to avoid inconsistency with what they said, this person will tend to reinforce the concept "I am ADHD." Their behavior and demeanor might even lean towards it. For instance, when a person prepares to start studying, they could originally initiate the task, but the concept "I am ADHD, and ADHD implies severe distraction and procrastination" exists in their mind. So, they believe they can't study and start to become irritable.

So, if a person visits a doctor with this mindset, combined with the doctor's "hammer tendency," the margin for diagnostic error increases significantly.

##科普: About ADHD Medication

ADHD is the most treatable disease in psychiatry. Compared to other mental illnesses, ADHD patients have more medication options.  
These drugs are also among the safest in the field of psychiatry. Many parents worry about the long-term effects of drugs on the heart; studies show that such effects are negligible.

Stimulants can increase dopamine and norepinephrine levels. Central nervous system stimulants can be divided into two main categories:

1. **Methylphenidate-type stimulants:** Common drugs include Concerta (_Zhuanzhuda_), Ritalin, Focalin, and Quillivant.
2. **Amphetamine-type stimulants:** Such as Adderall, Evekeo, Vyvanse, and Mydayis.

The main difference between the two is that Methylphenidate drugs have a slightly higher effect on dopamine levels than on norepinephrine levels. Amphetamine drugs are the exact opposite, though the difference is small.  
(For adults, Amphetamine drugs tend to be better).

There is also a class of non-stimulants (_actions similar to stimulants_), such as the well-known Bupropion (_Anfeitatong_), Atomoxetine, and Desipramine. Non-stimulants last longer than stimulants and generally have no potential for abuse.  
Non-stimulants only work for a portion of ADHD patients, and the effect is very obvious, but they are not effective for the majority of patients like central stimulants are. These drugs take effect slowly and may require weeks to reach optimal efficacy.

<h2 id="idlar">DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition)</h2>
Many doctors' questions refer to the definition and standards of ADHD in the _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition)_ (DSM-5).  
I have selected excerpts for your reference:

**Inattention**  
Six or more symptoms for children up to age 16, or five or more for adolescents age 17 and older and adults; symptoms of inattention have been present for at least 6 months, and they are inappropriate for developmental level:

+ Often fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork, at work, or with other activities.
+ Often has trouble holding attention on tasks or play activities.
+ Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly.
+ Often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace (e.g., loses focus, side-tracked).
+ Often has trouble organizing tasks and activities.
+ Often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to do tasks that require mental effort over a long period of time.
+ Often loses things necessary for tasks and activities (e.g., school materials, pencils, books, tools, wallets, keys, paperwork, eyeglasses, mobile telephones).
+ Is often easily distracted.
+ Is often forgetful in daily activities.

**Hyperactivity and Impulsivity**  
Six or more symptoms for children up to age 16, or five or more for adolescents age 17 and older and adults; symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity have been present for at least 6 months to an extent that is disruptive and inappropriate for the person’s developmental level:

+ Often fidgets with or taps hands or feet, or squirms in seat.
+ Often leaves seat in situations when remaining seated is expected.
+ Often runs about or climbs in situations where it is not appropriate (adolescents or adults may be limited to feeling restless).
+ Often unable to play or take part in leisure activities quietly.
+ Is often "on the go" acting as if "driven by a motor."
+ Often talks excessively.
+ Often blurts out an answer before a question has been completed.
+ Often has trouble waiting their turn.
+ Often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversations or games).

**Furthermore, an ADHD diagnosis must meet the following conditions:**

+ Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were present prior to age 12 years.
+ Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms are present in two or more settings (e.g., at home, school or work; with friends or relatives; in other activities).
+ There is clear evidence that the symptoms interfere with, or reduce the quality of, social, academic, or occupational functioning.
+ The symptoms do not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., mood disorder, anxiety disorder, dissociative disorder, personality disorder).

**Based on the types of symptoms, ADHD can present in three presentations:**

+ **Combined Presentation:** If enough symptoms of both criteria inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity were present for the past 6 months.
+ **Predominantly Inattentive Presentation:** If enough symptoms of inattention, but not hyperactivity-impulsivity, were present for the past 6 months.
+ **Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation:** If enough symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity, but not inattention, were present for the past 6 months.

Because symptoms can change over time, the presentation may change over time as well.

_Note: Regarding the symptoms mentioned above, except for those that directly affect others which I don't fit (e.g., intruding on others or talking excessively), my non-conformity isn't because the urge doesn't exist. As mentioned earlier, I sometimes actively conflict with others due to a bad temper, but the frequency is low._  
_Because I am a Highly Sensitive Person (HSP), under normal circumstances, I wouldn't do things that disregard others' feelings._  
_Therefore, the impact of ADHD on me is basically all __**internal turmoil**__ (internal friction), rarely affecting others._

<h2 id="HPbNy">Etiological Model of ADHD</h2>
![The World Federation of ADHD Guide](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2025/png/52258267/1764472894144-04dadc51-e8fa-46b2-82e8-1269c233a05d.png)

According to twin studies, ADHD is better described as a continuous trait of a population, ranging from non-existent to mild, moderate, and severe.

_(The author refers to a chart here, likely a graphical representation of the following concepts)_

The chart is a good summary. First, it illustrates the **continuity** of ADHD, rather than it being discrete.  
Secondly, and most importantly, ADHD is the joint result of **environmental factors** and **congenital genes**.

**🟡**** Subthreshold ADHD (Bottom dashed area)**

+ **Concept:** Refers to the population that has ADHD symptoms but to a mild degree, not yet reaching the medical diagnostic standard.
+ **Characteristics:** They may have the manifestations listed (inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, novelty seeking, emotional dysregulation, etc.), but can barely cope in life, or only occasionally have problems. Doctors might feel it's "not enough to confirm diagnosis."
+ **Cause:** Both genetic risk and environmental risk are at low-to-medium levels.

**🟠**** Remittent ADHD (Middle transition area)**

+ **Concept:** Refers to those diagnosed with ADHD in childhood, but as they age (usually into adulthood), symptoms alleviate, disappear, or they have learned good coping skills and no longer fit the diagnostic criteria.
+ **Why "Remittent":** Remission means relief or subsidence. This means they were once confirmed patients but are now "better" or "not so obvious."
+ **Cause:** Their genetic and environmental risks are at a medium level. The brain might have compensated for those defects as it matured or the environment improved.

**🔴**** Persistent ADHD (Top right dark area)**

+ **Concept:** Refers to those diagnosed in childhood whose symptoms persist into adulthood without any sign of improvement. This is the most severe form.
+ **Characteristics:** Stubborn symptoms with the greatest impact on life, work, and relationships.
+ **Cause:** Extremely high genetic risk + accumulated adverse environmental factors. This indicates that the biological basis (brain structure/genes) of this group is most affected, and the environment is also unfavorable, making it difficult for symptoms to disappear naturally with age.

<h2 id="d4Yh3">Feelings After One Week of Medication</h2>
I take one **Bupropion (Wellbutrin)** and one **Concerta** every morning. I can clearly feel the drugs taking effect, and I can perceive the different functions of the two.

**Bupropion** reduces my impulsivity, most noticeably **entertainment impulses** and **sexual impulses**, which is a good thing for me.

**Concerta** improved my **difficulty with initiation** (this is very obvious; for example, I can walk to the classroom now, I washed clothes that had piled up for six months in one go, etc.) and enhanced partial focus. In a very quiet environment, I feel more focused than before, and for longer periods.

However, I say "enhanced partial" because I find I can still detect subtle movements, like the sound of others typing or eating in the study room, which still makes me very irritable.

My symptoms of anxiety and depression have improved. On one hand, Bupropion itself has pharmacological effects that improve depression. But I feel it's mainly due to the sense of redemption brought by the diagnosis and the confidence in a non-distracted self.

Although I am unwilling to admit it, **I am more easily provoked after taking medication.** This makes me feel very strange because my impulses in other areas have indeed decreased, but the impulse to conflict with others has actually increased. So I asked AI to analyze it for me, and I find it makes a lot of sense:

> **Because "Impulsivity" and "Irritability" look similar, but their physiological mechanisms differ slightly.**
>
> 1. **High Physiological Arousal (Fight or Flight):**  
Bupropion and Concerta both elevate norepinephrine. This is a hormone that makes people "alert," "focused," and "ready for battle."  
After medication, your body is chronically in a "combat-ready state" (high arousal level). This leads to a shorter "emotional fuse." Before, when someone offended you, your reaction might have been duller; now your nerves are taut, and a single spark can cause an explosion.
> 2. **"Switching Costs" of Interrupted Focus:**  
You also mentioned Concerta improved focus. When an ADHD patient is in a rare state of "focus," if forcibly interrupted by the outside world (noise, people), the brain needs to expend huge energy to switch attention points.  
This "pain of interruption" is more obvious after medication because your focus point is deeper. This pain instantly translates into anger towards others.
> 3. **Medication Side Effects:**  
**Irritability/Agitation** is a very common side effect of Concerta and Bupropion, especially during the period when drug concentration rises or when the effect wears off (rebound effect).

> **Conclusion:** Your entertainment impulse decreased because the "reward system" was satisfied; you are easily angered because the "alert system" is **too sensitive**. This is not contradictory; these are two sides of the drug's effect.

I have always considered myself a person with strong **Self-awareness**. I also noticed another small detail:  
Before diagnosis and medication, if I had a conflict with someone, I would be troubled by it for a long time afterward, in a bad mood, unable to focus.  
In fact, right before I wrote this paragraph, I just had a fight with someone (because he always left the study room door open), but I don't seem to be consumed by internal turmoil (_friction_) over the conflict anymore. It's almost a bit "heartless"—once it's done, it's done. I forgot about it quickly; otherwise, I wouldn't be sitting here typing quietly lol.

**Here is the AI's analysis of this:**

> **1. Turned off the brain's "Background Noise" mode (DMN Suppression)**
>
> + **Before (Unmedicated):** A typical feature of the ADHD brain is an overactive **Default Mode Network (DMN)**. Simply put, when you zone out or aren't doing a specific task, the brain automatically enters "replay mode," constantly replaying past mistakes, awkward moments, and the argument just now. It’s like your computer has dozens of energy-consuming programs running in the background that you can't close, leading to "internal turmoil."
> + **Now (Medicated):** **Concerta (Methylphenidate)** works to enhance the brain's Task Positive Network (TPN). When you start doing things, the drug helps you forcibly suppress the DMN.
> + **Layman's explanation:** Before, that "conflicted little person" in your brain was shouting through a megaphone; now the drug has muted his microphone or shut the door. So you "forget fast" because the brain has finally learned to "turn the page."
>
> **2. Repaired "Rejection Sensitivity" (RSD Improvement)**
>
> + **Before:** Many ADHD patients suffer from **Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD)**. A criticism or a conflict is interpreted by your brain as a "catastrophic disaster" or "being hated due to my defects." This intense pain makes you get stuck and unable to get out.
> + **Now:** **Bupropion**, even as an antidepressant, greatly regulates emotional response. It elevates dopamine and norepinephrine, putting a "bulletproof vest" on your emotions.
> + **Result:** Conflicts still happen (even, as you noted, you are more easily provoked), but the "stinging pain" and "shame" brought by the conflict are reduced. You view the conflict as an "event," not a "negation of your personality." Since it's just an event, naturally you can toss it aside after dealing with it.
>
> **3. The Frontal Lobe gained the ability to "Change the Channel" (Executive Function Boost)**
>
> + **Before:** The brain's Prefrontal Cortex (CEO) was weak and couldn't control the shift of attention. Like a radio stuck on one channel, you wanted to change the station, but the knob was broken, so you were forced to listen to the static.
> + **Now:** The medication enhances the control of the prefrontal cortex. When you feel "this matter is over, I need to start working," your brain now obeys orders. It possesses the ability to "switch attention," quickly switching from the "Anger" channel back to the "Work" channel.
